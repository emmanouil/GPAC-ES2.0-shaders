# GPAC-ES2.0-shaders
shader bucket of beta shaders for GPAC

----------

[GPAC](https://github.com/gpac/gpac) is an open-source project for multimedia content. This is a git repo of working (but not used) shaders. All shaders should work both for Desktop OpenGL and OpenGL ES2.0

List of functions (some) shaders can perfom:

 - Clipping
 - RGB + YUV Texturing
 - RGB + YUV Texturing (PoT)
 - Lighting (Spot, Directional, Point)

 *drafts.zip* contains shaders with limited functionality
 
**NOTE:** This repository is **NOT** maintained, it serves as a backup, for the most recent shaders, you should refer to the [GPAC](https://github.com/gpac/gpac) repo.
